Server Development with Node.js and Express.js

Description:
This file serves as the entry point for your Node.js Express server. It initializes the server, sets up necessary middleware, establishes a connection to the MongoDB database, loads environment variables from a .env file, imports routes, and listens for incoming requests.

Dependencies:
-express: Used to create the server and handle HTTP requests.
-mongoose: Provides an interface for MongoDB interactions.
-cors: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
-dotenv: Loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.
-body-parser: Middleware for parsing request bodies.
-cookie-parser: Middleware for parsing cookies.

Setup and Configuration:

Server Initialization:
-Initializes Express server.
-Configures middleware for handling JSON request bodies (express.json()).
-Configures middleware for parsing cookies (cookie-parser).
-Sets up CORS middleware to handle Cross-Origin requests.
-Database Connection:

Connects to MongoDB using the provided connection string from the environment variables.
Environment Variables:

Loads environment variables from the .env file using dotenv.
Route Configuration:

Imports route handlers for different parts of the application.
Defines routes for authentication, user management, product/service management, event management, stall management, visitor management, etc.

Error Handling:
Sets up error handling middleware to catch and handle errors thrown by the application.

Usage:
-Run the server using node server.js or using a process manager like PM2 for production environments.
-Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible.
-Make sure to set environment variables like PORT, MONGOURI, and others required for the application to function properly.

Security Considerations:
-Ensure proper security measures are in place, such as input validation, authentication, and authorization checks, especially for routes handling sensitive operations or user data.
-Regularly update dependencies and review code for security vulnerabilities.
